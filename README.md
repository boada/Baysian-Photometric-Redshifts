A python2/3 compatible version of the BPZ library, because the original library was written a long time ago and never updated. This should run in both a python2.7+ and python3.5+ enviroment. Or at least that is what I used to test it. 

You can find the original code here. http://www.stsci.edu/~dcoe/BPZ/

I'm not supporting this beyond what I need for my personal projects. You are welcome to issue pull requests for anything that is broken, but I doubt that I will fix any issues that crop up.
